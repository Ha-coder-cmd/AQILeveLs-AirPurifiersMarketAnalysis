Air Purifiers Market & AQI Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project, Air Purifiers Analysis, is a resume-focused case study that analyzes air quality trends in India and evaluates the market fit for air purifiers. The study explores air pollution data, health impacts, competitor analysis, and product development opportunities for the startup AirPure Innovations, which was born out of India’s growing air quality crisis.

🎯 Problem Statement

India has 14 cities ranking among the world’s top 20 most polluted urban centers.
The objective of this project is to determine whether there is a strong, sustained demand for air purifiers by analyzing:

Air Quality Index (AQI) patterns across states and cities

Pollutant distribution in Southern India

Correlation between AQI & health outcomes

Competitor positioning & market size

Consumer awareness and policy impacts

🔍 Primary Analysis

Top & Bottom 5 Areas by AQI (Dec 2024 – May 2025)

Prominent Pollutants in Southern States (Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh – post-COVID data)

Weekday vs Weekend AQI in Metro Cities (Delhi, Pune, Kolkata, Chennai)

Weekend AQI improves significantly in Delhi.

Seasonal AQI Trends

Nov & Dec show the worst AQI due to festivals, seasonal changes, and stubble burning.

City-Level Analysis – Bengaluru (Mar & Apr 2025)

79% days had Satisfactory AQI

Rest were Moderate, unhealthy for sensitive groups.

AQI vs Diseases

Identified top 2 most reported illnesses per state vs average AQI.

EV Adoption & AQI

Karnataka & Tamil Nadu show improved AQI compared to states with low EV adoption.

Vulnerable Age Groups

Children & elderly most affected by PM2.5 exposure.

Studies show infants in polluted areas are 2x more likely to die in infancy.

🧪 Secondary Analysis

Elderly Mortality – 13% higher odds of death in PM2.5-heavy regions.

Policy Impact (2019–2024) –

BS-VI Vehicle Emission Norms (2020) reduced PM2.5 & PM10 significantly.

Best improvement: Kolkata (~40% drop).

Limited impact in Delhi & Lucknow due to stubble burning & industrial factors.

🏢 Competitor Analysis (2025)
Brand	Segment	Price Range	Differentiators
Dyson	Premium	₹30K – ₹60K+	Glass HEPA filter, Air Multiplier™, smart features, premium design
Philips	Mid to Premium	₹10K – ₹35K	VitaShield IPS, bacteria/allergen removal, real-time AQI, sleep mode
Xiaomi (Mi)	Budget to Mid	₹8K – ₹15K	True HEPA (99.97%), smart app, OLED AQI display, great value

📊 Market Share (2024):

Xiaomi → 25.3%

Philips → 18.6%

Dyson → 13.4%

🌍 Key Insights

Awareness of AQI terms growing, with “AQI near me” trending in polluted cities (Delhi, Mumbai, Lucknow, Kanpur).

Pediatric asthma strongly correlated with AQI spikes.

Tier-1/2 cities show irreversible AQI degradation despite policies.

💡 Recommendations

Smart AQI Syncing: Available only in premium models; missing in budget ones.

Compact Designs: Urban homes need wall-mountable/modular purifiers.

Product Development Opportunity:

3-in-1 Air Purifier (Purify + Heat + Cool)

Already popular in Europe (e.g., Blueair T10i) but missing in India.

Potential to launch compact, affordable models tailored for Indian climate.
